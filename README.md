# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web application that helps users understand various sorting algorithms through visual representation. This project aims to provide an interactive and educational experience for learning how different sorting algorithms work.

Currently supports only three sorting algorithms :
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms
- Step-by-step execution of algorithms
- Adjustable speed for visualization
- Support for multiple sorting algorithms:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    
## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
